# Genesis Game Jam 2.0
> Save gamedev

‚ö† <b>Warning!</b> This game was made in less than 48 hours, so the quality of code and product is very poor (but anyway we took <b><i>2nd place</i></b> ü§£).

<b>Theme:</b> Matrix

## Idea
Agent Smith decided to launch a global virus and destroy all video games. You play as Neo, your goal is to get into several famous games and eliminate bugs. This game contains 3 remakes of popular video games and 1 app: <i>Portal</i>, <i>Mortal Kombat</i>, <i>Mario</i> & <i>Windows CMD</i>. In the first game, you need to shoot your enemies with a portal gun. In the second game, you need to fight enemies using a katana. In the third game you need to complete the 2D level (like in the original Mario game). In the last, fourth game, you need to quickly enter commands in the console to defeat the main boss. That's all! üòÅ
